/// A file contain a list for discussion during research around cyberd. If some useful considerations sparks around some points an issue with tag discussion must be created.

# Discussion topics

- User has tokens (power of linking) and reputation which equal sum of link's weights created/connected to their Q/A.

- reputation vesting ~ inflation <- function *

- link weight ~ reputation <- function *

- broadband ~ reputation <- function *

- link weight applying with quadratic voting

- Retire CID in favor for DURI user defined domain registries

- Discussion on anonimity, complexity of a protocol and expensiveness of computation

- Discuss decay of links with time

- language incentivization bias_. In the core of cyberd is quadratic voting. The system needs it to effectively incentivize participants for quality ranking. But that natively leads to weak incentives across different language groups. E.g blockchain Golos was deployed as Russian alternative to Steem because Russian posts acquired only 0.2% of rewards though providing 10% of the content. The idea of deploying cyberd is great if it can be truly global from the start. The only way to overcome this bias is a global deployment from day 0, because otherwise we need significantly increase the complexity of the reward system. We offer good incentives for translation of this white paper to 50 languages worldwide as well as call for action to all blockchain communities across the globe.
