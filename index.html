                            An incentivized consensus computer would allow to compute provably relevant answers without opinionated blackbox
                            intermediaries such as Google. Stateless content-addressable peer-to-peer communication networks such as IPFS and
                            stateful consensus computers such as Ethereum provide part of the solution but there are at least three problems
                            associated with implementation. Of course, the first problem is subjective nature of relevance. The second problem
                            is that it is hard to scale consensus computer of huge knowledge graph. The third problem is that the quality of
                            such knowledge graph will suffer from different attack surfaces such as sybil and selfish behavior of interacting
                            agents. In this paper we (1) define a protocol for provable consensus computing of relevance between IPFS objects
                            based on some offline observation and theory behind prediction markets, (2) solve a problem of implementation
                            inside consensus computer based on SpringRank and propose workaround for pruning historical state and (3) design
                            distribution and incentive scheme based on our experience and known attacks. Also we discuss some considerations on
                            minimalistic architecture of the protocol as we believe that is critical for formation of a network of domain
                            specific search consensus computers. As result of our work some applications never existed before emerge.

                        <p>
                            Original protocols of the Internet such as TCP/IP, DNS, URL and HTTPS brought a web into the point there it is now. Along with
                            all benefits they has created they brought more problem into the table. Globality being a key property of the the web
                            since inception is under real threat. Speed of connections degrade with network grow and from ubiquitous government
                            interventions into privacy and security of web users. One property, not obvious in the beginning, become really
                            important with everyday usage of the Internet: its ability to exchange permanent hyperlinks thus they would not break
                            after time have pass. Reliance on one at a time internet service provider architecture allow governments censor packets
                            is the last straw in conventional web stack for every engineer who is concerned about the future of our children. Other
                            properties while being not so critical are very desirable: offline and real-time. Average internet user being offline
                            must have ability to work with the state it has and after acquiring connection being able to sync with global state and
                            continue verify state&apos;s validity in realtime while having connection. Now this properties offered on app level
                            while such properties must be integrated into lower level protocols.

                        <p> 
                            The emergence of a distributed protocol stack [W3S] creates an opportunity for a new kind of Internet. We call it web3.
                            It has a promise to remove problems of conventional protocol stack and add to the web better speed and more accessible
                            connection. But as usually in a story with a new stack, new problems emerge. One of such problem is general purpose
                            search. Existing general purpose search engines are restrictive centralized databases everybody forced to trust. These
                            search engines were designed primarily for client-server architecture based on TCP/IP, DNS, URL and HTPPS protocols.
                            Web3 create a challenge and opportunity for a search engine based on developing technologies and specifically designed
                            for them. Surprisingly the permission-less blockchain architecture itself allows organizing general purpose search
                            engine in a way inaccessible for previous architectures

                            A useful property of a computer is that it must have inductive reasoning property. She must be able to interfere
                            predictions without any knowledge about objects except when, who and where some prediction was asked. If we assume
                            that a consensus computer must have some information about linked objects the complexity of such model growth
                            unpredictably, hence a requirements for a computer for memory and computations. That is, deduction of a meaning
                            inside consensus computer is expensive thus our design hardly depend on the blindness assumption. Instead we design
                            incentives around meaning extractions

                            A problem here is that computational complexity of conventional ranks grow sublineary with the growth of the
                            network. So we need to find (1) deterministic algorithm that allow to compute a rank for continuously appended
                            network to scale the consensus computer to orders of magnitude that of Google. Perfect algorithm (2) must have
                            linear memory and computation complexity. The most importantly without having (3) good prediction capabilities for
                            existence of relevant links it proves to be useless. One of recent algorithms: SpringRank.

                            global language everybody can accept. Recent scientific advances in machine translation [GNMT] are breathtaking but
                            meaningless for those who wish to apply them without Google scale trained model. Proposed cyber•rank offers exactly

                            Following ideas from Tezos we can define the current state of a protocol as immutable content address. Thus she can
                            adopt to a new environment changing content address of current protocol following the rules hidden behind previous
                            protocol. We would love to check the hypothesis that it is possible to have a protocol which follows simple rule:
                        </p><br>
                        <p class="linkcolor">
                            &#60; The more closer some content address to literally cyber-protocol-current ipfs address the more probability than it will
                            become winning. The most close protocol cyber-protocol-current is the protocol which is the most relevant to users. &#62;
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            Thus nodes must always signal connection with cyber-protocol-current by sending linkchains with semantics like
                            &lt;{cyber-protocol-current}&gt; &lt;cid&gt;.

                            Decentralization comes with costs and slowness. We want to find a good balance between those as we believe both are
                            sensitive for widespread web3 adoption. That is the area of research for us now.

                        <p>
                            Proposed blockchain design is based on Tendermint consensus algorithm and has fast and predictable before seconds
                            block confirmation time and very fast finality time. Average confirmation timeframe is less than second thus
                            conformations can be asynchronous and nearly invisible for users. A good thing is that users don&apos;t need
                            confirmations at all before getting search response as there is no risk associated with that.

                            Let us say that our node implementation based on Cosmos-SDK can process 10k transactions per second. Thus every day at
                            least 8.64 million nodes can submit 100 predictions and get back search results simultaneously. That is enough to
                            verify all assumptions in the wild. As blockchain technology evolve we want to check that every hypothesis work before
                            scale it further.

                            We describe a motivated blockchain based search engine for web3. A search engine is based on the content-addressable
                            peer-to-peer paradigm and uses IPFS as a foundation. IPFS provide significant benefits in terms of resources
                            consumption. IPFS addresses as a primary objects are robust in its simplicity. For every IPFS hash cyber•rank is
                            computed by a consensus computer with no single point of failure. Cyber•rank is a spring rank with economic protection
                            from selfish predictions. Sybil resistance is also implemented on two levels: during id generation and during bandwidth
                            limiting. Embedded smart contracts offer fair compensations for those who is able to predict relevance of content
                            addresses. The primary goal is indexing of peer-to-peer systems with self-authenticated data either stateless, such as
                            IPFS, Swarm, DAT, Git, BitTorent, or stateful such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and other blockchains and tangles. Proposed
                            semantics of linking offers robust mechanism for predicting meaningful relations between objects. A source code of a
                            relevance machine is open source. Every bit of data accumulated by a consensus computer is available for everybody if
                            the one has resources to process it. The performance of proposed software implementation is sufficient for seamless
                            user interactions. Scalability of proposed implementation is enough to index all self-authenticated data that exist
                            today. The blockchain is managed by a decentralized autonomous organization which functions under Tendermint consensus
                            algorithm. Thought a system provide necessary utility to offer an alternative for conventional search engines it is not
                            limited to this use case either. The system is extendable for numerous applications and e.g. makes possible to design
                            economically rational self-owned robots that are able to autonomously understand objects around them.
